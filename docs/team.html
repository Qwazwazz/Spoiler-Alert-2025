                  Parker is a senior computer science major at Old Dominion University. He has many years of programming experience, focusing mainly on Python and game development. However, he also has experience in Rust, C++, Java, and Assembly. His latest coding facinations are the afformentioned Rust and the game engine Godot. Outside of programming, Parker still enjoys his all time favorite game Minecraft. In the last few years, Parker has been keeping his eye on food recalls, starting back when his family had Guinea Pigs. The pets would get fed romaine lettuce, which would seemingly get recalled at least once a year because of E. Coli.
