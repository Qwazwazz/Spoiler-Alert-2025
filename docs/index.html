                    <p>Spoiler Alert is an innovative web and mobile application designed to deliver personalized, immediate, and trustworthy food recall alerts. By combining speed, clarity, and reliability, Spoiler Alert ensures that users receive instant notifications through text, push, or email whenever a recall occurs. The platform uses simple, consumer-friendly language to communicate critical safety information and allows users to personalize their experience through allergy filters, barcode or receipt scanning, and custom notification settings. All alerts are sourced directly from verified FDA and USDA data, providing users with confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the information. Ultimately, Spoiler Alert helps families, caregivers, and vulnerable individuals stay informed and safe—ensuring that there are no surprises at the table.</p>
                <header><strong>Customer/End user</strong></header>
                    <p>Spoiler Alert is designed for anyone who buys, cooks, or consumes food—especially those who want to stay proactive about food safety. Our primary end users are everyday consumers, including families, caregivers, and individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or health conditions that make them more vulnerable to foodborne illnesses. These users rely on Spoiler Alert to receive timely, accurate notifications that help them make safe decisions about what they eat. Our customers also include businesses and organizations that benefit from improved recall communication, such as grocery stores, restaurants, and food service providers. By staying informed about recalls, these establishments can take quick action to remove affected products, maintain consumer trust, and prevent potential health risks. Together, Spoiler Alert empowers both consumers and businesses to create a safer food environment for everyone.</p>
                <header><strong>Problem Description</strong></header>
                    <p>Food recalls occur frequently, yet there is no efficient or accessible system that ensures consumers are promptly informed. Many people remain unaware of recalls that could directly affect the safety of the food they consume. Official recall resources often rely on outdated email alerts, which are easily overlooked in today’s mobile-driven world. Existing applications also fail to engage users—they lack personalization, accessibility, and real-time updates. This gap leaves families, caregivers, and vulnerable individuals at risk of consuming unsafe products without ever realizing it.</p>
